                        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 60 minutes</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Problem:</strong> A request routing workflow &mdash; submit request, goes to the

                        </p>

                        <h3>Explicit Centaur Pattern</h3>
                        <p>
                            This build follows the centaur pattern: distinct human phases and AI phases
                            with clear boundaries between them.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Phase 1 &mdash; Human Designs</h4>
                        <p>
                            Define the approval chain, business rules, and notifications on a whiteboard.
                            No AI. Who approves what? What are the dollar thresholds? What happens when
                            an approver is unavailable? Map it all out by hand first.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Phase 2 &mdash; AI Builds</h4>
                        <p>
                            Feed the design to AI. Build the Power App form and Power Automate flow based
                            on the whiteboard design. The AI handles the execution &mdash; translating your
                            design into working platform components.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Phase 3 &mdash; Human Verifies</h4>
                        <p>
                            Test every path. Is the right person notified? What about edge cases? Submit
                            test requests through every branch of your approval chain and verify the
                            results against your whiteboard design.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Phase 4 &mdash; AI Refines</h4>
                        <p>
                            Feed test results back to the AI for fixes. Describe exactly what failed,
                            what you expected, and what happened instead. Let the AI adjust the
                            implementation.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Phase 5 &mdash; Human Accepts</h4>
                        <p>
                            Final review. Walk through the complete workflow one more time. Does it match
                            the original design? Is it ready for users?
                        </p>

                        <div class="callout">
                            <h3 class="callout__title">Key Teaching Point</h3>
                            <p>
                                At every phase boundary, there is a verification checkpoint. The human is
                                responsible for design and verification. The AI handles execution. This
                                separation is what makes centaur mode reliable for critical workflows.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>This is NOT optional.</strong> This is one of the most important 15 minutes

                        <p>
                            Document failures on a whiteboard or shared document. Look for patterns across
                            the group. This becomes the beginning of the unit's frontier map &mdash; a living
                            record of where AI works well and where it does not.

                                Create psychological safety. Frame failures as valuable data, not
                                embarrassments. Lead by sharing your own failures first. The more specific
                                and honest the sharing, the more useful the frontier map becomes.

                        <h2>Module 4: Build #2 &mdash; Iterative Application, Cyborg Mode</h2>
                        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 60 minutes</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Problem:</strong> A training tracker that pulls from multiple sources and
                            generates reports.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Explicit Cyborg Pattern</h3>
                        <p>
                            No distinct phases. Continuous back-and-forth between human and AI. The boundary
                            between human thinking and AI execution is fluid.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Start rough: <em>"I need to see which Marines have completed which training
                            events."</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>Build incrementally:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Data model &mdash; what tables, what columns, what relationships</li>
                            <li>Input form &mdash; how does training data get entered</li>
                            <li>Dashboard &mdash; what does leadership need to see at a glance</li>
                            <li>Reports &mdash; what gets printed, emailed, or briefed</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            Evaluate and redirect at each step. You are discovering requirements as you
                            build, not executing a predetermined plan.
                        </p>

                                Cyborg mode is faster but requires more constant attention. You cannot walk
                                away and let the AI run. Best for situations where you are discovering
                                requirements as you build &mdash; where you do not fully know what you want until
                                you see it taking shape.

                        <p>
                            Each participant builds the solution they identified during Builder Orientation.
                            This is their real problem with their real requirements.
                        </p>

                        <p>Before starting, each participant states:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>What they are building</strong> (one sentence)</li>
                            <li><strong>Which mode</strong> (centaur or cyborg) and why</li>
                            <li><strong>Where they expect frontier issues</strong> &mdash; the places where AI is likely to struggle</li>

                                Resist solving every problem. When a participant gets stuck, ask:
                                <em>"What would you tell the AI about what is going wrong?"</em> This builds
                                the self-sufficiency they need to work independently after the course.
