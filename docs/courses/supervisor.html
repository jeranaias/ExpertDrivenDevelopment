                            Ethan Mollick's research shows that workers are already using AI &mdash; and
                            hiding it. They are worried about organizational reaction, not about the
                            technology itself. The permission gap &mdash; not the technology &mdash; is the
                            largest barrier to AI adoption in your section.

                            The data is unambiguous. AI adoption with proper leadership support produces
                            measurable results. AI adoption without it fails consistently.

                        <h2>Module 3: Evaluating AI-Assisted Output <span class="badge">10 min</span></h2>

                        <p>
                            When a Marine brings you AI-assisted work, you need exactly four questions:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Does it work?</strong> Can you demonstrate it?</li>
                            <li><strong>Is the output accurate?</strong> Verifiable facts, references, numbers?</li>
                            <li><strong>Does it follow the SOP?</strong> Proper review process completed?</li>
                            <li><strong>Does it save time?</strong> Before-and-after comparison?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            You do not need to evaluate <em>how</em> AI produced it. Focus on output, not
                            mechanism. Apply the same standards as any work product &mdash; if a Marine
                            handed you this without mentioning AI, would you sign it?
                        </p>

                        <h3>Practice Scenarios</h3>
                        <p>
                            Supervisors must practice evaluation before they need it operationally. Work through
                            these two scenarios. What questions would you ask?
                        </p>

                        <div class="template-display">

                                A Marine presents you with a one-page summary of leave policy for Emergency Leave
                                Authorization. The summary is clear, well-formatted, and cites MCO P1050.3K. The
                                Marine tells you it was generated using ChatGPT and reviewed for accuracy. They want
                                to distribute it to the section.
                            </p>

                                    <li><strong>Can you verify the MCO citation?</strong> Pull up the actual order. Does the summary match?</li>
                                    <li><strong>What did you use as the AI input?</strong> Did you paste the full MCO text, or ask general questions? Context quality matters.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Who reviewed this for accuracy?</strong> AI-generated policy content requires subject-matter verification, not just proofreading.</li>
                                    <li><strong>What happens if the policy changes?</strong> Is there a process to update this, or will outdated summaries circulate indefinitely?</li>
                                </ul>

                                A Marine built a Python script that pulls data from a shared spreadsheet and
                                auto-generates the weekly operations summary. It runs in 30 seconds. The manual
                                process took 90 minutes. The Marine wants approval to use it for official reporting.

                            <h3 class="callout__title">The Risk: Junior Marines Who Never Learn Fundamentals</h3>
                            <p>
                                If AI handles all the routine tasks that junior Marines traditionally learned on,
                                they never develop professional judgment. They become dependent on tools they don't
                                understand. Entry-level employment in AI-exposed fields has dropped 13% since 2022.
                                The military cannot afford a generation of Marines who can operate AI but cannot
                                operate without it.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Supervisors Must Ensure AI Augments, Not Replaces, Development</h3>
                        <p>
                            AI is a force multiplier for trained professionals. It is a crutch for untrained juniors.
                            Your role is to ensure the former, prevent the latter.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Three Supervision Checks</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Can the Marine explain the output without referencing AI?</strong> If they can't walk you through the logic, they didn't learn &mdash; they copied.</li>
                            <li><strong>Require periodic tasks to be completed without AI.</strong> Preserve baseline competency. If the tool disappears, can they still operate?</li>
                            <li><strong>Use AI output as a teaching tool.</strong> &ldquo;Is this correct? How would you verify it? What would happen if this number was wrong?&rdquo;</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Developmental Assignments Are Non-Negotiable</h3>
                        <p>
                            Certain tasks exist to build judgment, not just complete work. Writing after-action
                            reviews, analyzing lessons learned, drafting initial counseling statements &mdash; these
                            are formative assignments. AI can assist, but it cannot replace the learning value of
                            the work itself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Goal: AI-augmented Marines, not AI-dependent ones.</strong>

                                <li><strong>The Marine can explain the output without referencing AI.</strong> They understand the work, not just the tool.</li>
                                <li><strong>Failed experiments are shared openly.</strong> Learning culture, not fear culture.</li>
                                <li><strong>AI is saving time on routine tasks, not replacing judgment tasks.</strong> Force multiplier, not replacement.</li>

                                <li><strong>The Marine cannot answer basic questions about their own output.</strong> Dependency, not augmentation.</li>
                                <li><strong>AI use is hidden or apologized for.</strong> Sign of a fear culture you created.</li>
                                <li><strong>Junior Marines are skipping foundational tasks entirely.</strong> No baseline competency being built.</li>
