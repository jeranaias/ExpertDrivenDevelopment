                                measurable outcomes. If supervisors do not buy in, their Marines will not get the

                                within two weeks. Subsequent tools are built faster and pay off sooner.

                        <p>
                            Before a Marine starts building, they must submit a problem definition for your
                            approval. Here is what to look for and what to flag.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What to Verify</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The problem is real:</strong> Is this an actual pain point in the section, or a solution looking for a problem?</li>
                            <li><strong>The scope is small enough:</strong> Can this be built in under 8 hours? If not, can it be broken into smaller pieces?</li>
                            <li><strong>The users are identified:</strong> Who will use this tool? Have they been consulted about what they need?</li>
                            <li><strong>The data is appropriate:</strong> Does the tool handle PII, classified information, or sensitive data? If so, it requires additional review.</li>
                            <li><strong>The outcome is measurable:</strong> How will you know if the tool is successful? What metric improves?</li>
                        </ul>

                                <li><strong>"I want to build something cool."</strong> &mdash; No defined problem. Redirect to identifying an actual pain point.</li>
                                <li><strong>"This will replace the entire [major system]."</strong> &mdash; Scope too large. Break it down or defer to IT.</li>
                                <li><strong>"Only I understand how it works."</strong> &mdash; No documentation plan. Require documentation before approval.</li>
                                <li><strong>"It needs to connect to [external system]."</strong> &mdash; May require IT involvement for connectors or credentials.</li>
                                <li><strong>"I'll work on it in my free time."</strong> &mdash; EDD should be allocated duty time, not personal time. If it is worth building, it is worth scheduling.</li>

                    <section id="your-role">
                        <h2>Your Role in the Workflow</h2>

                        <p>
                            As a supervisor, you have five specific responsibilities in the EDD workflow:
                        </p>

                        <ol class="steps">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Approve problem definitions.</strong>
                                Review the submitted problem definition. Verify it meets the criteria above.
                                Either approve it with a time allocation or send it back with specific feedback
                                on what needs to change.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Allocate protected build time.</strong>
                                Schedule specific blocks of time for your Marine to build. This is not "when
                                you get a chance" time. Put it on the training schedule. Protect it from
                                tasking conflicts. A Marine who gets interrupted every 15 minutes will never
                                finish a tool.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Check in at milestones.</strong>
                                Do not wait until the tool is "done" to review it. Check in at three points:
                                after the data structure is built, after the first working screen or flow,
                                and before final deployment. Early feedback prevents wasted effort.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Ensure documentation exists.</strong>
                                Before a tool goes into production use, verify that documentation exists:
                                what the tool does, who uses it, how to maintain it, and who to contact if
                                it breaks. A tool without documentation is a tool that will become a problem.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Report outcomes.</strong>
                                Track and report the impact of EDD tools in your section. How much time was
                                saved? What process improved? This data justifies continued investment in the
                                program and helps other sections identify similar opportunities.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                            <p>
                                The most common failure mode for EDD is not technical &mdash; it is supervisors
                                who approve projects but never allocate time, or who approve time but never
                                check in. Emphasize that active supervision makes the difference between a
                                tool that ships and a tool that dies on someone's desktop.

                                Your role is not to understand the technology. Your role is to understand the
                                problem, protect the time, check the progress, and verify the documentation.
                                The process works when supervisors are engaged. It stalls when they are not.
