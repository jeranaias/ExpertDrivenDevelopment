                        <h3>When You Need Multiple Apps</h3>
                        <p>
                            A single Power App can handle most problems. But when your solution needs different
                            interfaces for different users, automated workflows that run on schedules, and a
                            dashboard that aggregates data from multiple sources, you need to think about
                            architecture before you start building.
                        </p>

                        <p>Signs you need multiple components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Different user groups need different screens and different permissions</li>
                            <li>Data flows between multiple SharePoint lists or external systems</li>
                            <li>Actions need to happen automatically on a schedule or based on triggers</li>
                            <li>Leadership needs a high-level view while operators need a detailed view</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Architecture Prompt Pattern</h3>
                        <p>Before building anything, use this prompt to plan your architecture:</p>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <span class="code-block__label">Prompt &mdash; Architecture Planning</span>
                            <pre><code>I need to build a solution for [describe the overall problem].

The users are:
- [Role 1]: needs to [what they do]
- [Role 2]: needs to [what they do]
- [Role 3]: needs to [what they do]

The data includes:
- [Data type 1]: [describe fields and volume]
- [Data type 2]: [describe fields and volume]

Things that need to happen automatically:
- [Trigger/schedule 1]: [what should happen]
- [Trigger/schedule 2]: [what should happen]

Using Microsoft Power Platform (SharePoint, Power Apps, Power Automate,
Power BI), design an architecture for this solution. Tell me:
1. What SharePoint lists I need and how they relate to each other
2. How many Power Apps I need and what each one does
3. What Power Automate flows I need and what triggers them
4. What Power BI dashboards I need and who sees them
5. A build order - what to create first, second, third</code></pre>

                            <p>
                                This is a lecture/discussion module. Walk through a real-world example: a company
                                operations suite with separate apps for the motor pool, supply, and training sections,
                                all feeding a single leadership dashboard. Draw the architecture on a whiteboard or
                                shared screen. Emphasize that planning before building saves massive rework later.

- Operators: submit maintenance requests for their equipment
- Mechanics: view assigned requests, update status, log work performed
- Supervisors: see all requests, assign mechanics, approve completed work

Create two SharePoint lists:

List 1 - "MaintenanceRequests":
- RequestID (auto-generated number)
- EquipmentName (text)
- BumperNumber (text)
- ReportedBy (person)
- ProblemDescription (multiline text)
- Priority (choice: Routine, Urgent, Deadline)
- Status (choice: Submitted, Assigned, In Progress, Completed, Verified)
- AssignedMechanic (person)
- DateSubmitted (date, auto-set to today)
- DateCompleted (date)

List 2 - "WorkLog":
- RelatedRequest (lookup to MaintenanceRequests)
- Mechanic (person)
- WorkPerformed (multiline text)
- PartsUsed (multiline text)
- HoursSpent (number)
- DateLogged (date)

Give me the SharePoint setup steps for both lists.</code></pre>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Phase 2: Role-Based Screens</h3>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <span class="code-block__label">Prompt &mdash; Role Screens</span>
                            <pre><code>Create a Power Apps canvas app for the maintenance request system with
role-based navigation. The app should detect the current user's role
from a SharePoint list called "UserRoles" (columns: Email, Role).

Screen layout by role:

OPERATOR screens:
- Submit Request form (pre-fill ReportedBy with current user)
- My Requests gallery (filtered to current user, sorted by date)

MECHANIC screens:
- Assigned to Me gallery (filtered to AssignedMechanic = current user)
- Work Log form (linked to selected request)
- Mark Complete button

SUPERVISOR screens:
- All Requests gallery with filter/sort options
- Assign Mechanic screen (select request, pick mechanic from people picker)
- Dashboard summary: counts by Status, average completion time

Show the user only the screens for their role. Give me the Power Apps
implementation steps including the role-detection logic.</code></pre>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Phase 3: Navigation and Polish</h3>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <span class="code-block__label">Prompt &mdash; Navigation</span>
                            <pre><code>Add these finishing touches to the maintenance request app:

1. A home screen that greets the user by name and shows their role.
   Display navigation buttons only for screens they have access to.
2. A consistent header bar on every screen with the app title, current
   user name, and a Home button.
3. Conditional formatting: requests with Priority "Deadline" should have
   a red border. Requests open longer than 7 days should show a warning icon.
4. A confirmation dialog before changing request status: "Are you sure
   you want to mark this as [new status]?"

Give me the Power Apps formulas and configuration for each feature.</code></pre>
                        </div>

                                The role-based logic is the hardest part. Common issues: (1) the UserRoles list
                                lookup does not match the current user's email format, (2) navigation logic
                                not correctly hiding screens, (3) lookup columns between lists not configured
                                properly. Walk through Phase 2 step by step. Let participants tackle Phase 3
                                independently.

Trigger: When a MaintenanceRequests item's Status changes to "Completed".

Approval chain:
1. First approval: Maintenance Supervisor reviews the work log.
   - If approved, move to step 2.
   - If rejected, set Status back to "In Progress" and notify the mechanic.
2. Second approval: Equipment owner (the original ReportedBy) verifies
   the repair is satisfactory.
   - If approved, set Status to "Verified" and update DateCompleted.
   - If rejected, set Status back to "In Progress" and notify both the
     mechanic and supervisor.

Timeout: If either approver does not respond within 24 hours, send a
reminder. After 48 hours total, escalate to the next level.

                        <p>
                            Production flows must handle failures gracefully. Always implement logging
                            and notification for flow failures.

                            <pre><code>Add robust error handling to my Power Automate flows using this pattern:

1. Wrap the main logic in a Scope action called "Try".
2. Add a parallel Scope called "Catch" configured to run only if "Try" fails.
3. In the "Catch" scope:
   a. Create an item in a "FlowErrorLog" SharePoint list with columns:
      FlowName (text), ErrorMessage (multiline text), ErrorTimestamp (date),
      TriggerInfo (multiline text), Status (choice: New, Investigating, Resolved)
   b. Send an email to the flow admin with the error details.
   c. If the flow is business-critical, also send a Teams notification.
4. Add a "Finally" scope that always runs, logging that the flow executed
   (for auditing regardless of success or failure).

Show me how to implement this pattern and how to read error details
from the result() function in Power Automate.</code></pre>

                                The try/catch pattern in Power Automate uses "Configure run after" settings on
                                parallel branches. This is unintuitive for most participants. Demo the pattern
                                once on screen, then have participants implement it in their own flows. The
                                FlowErrorLog list is extremely valuable in production &mdash; emphasize that
                                every production flow should have error logging.

                        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 15 minutes</p>

                        <p>
                            As an advanced EDD practitioner, you will be asked to help others. Here are
                            three principles for effective knowledge transfer:
                        </p>

                        <h3>Principle 1: Guide, Don't Build</h3>
                        <p>
                            When someone asks for help, resist the urge to take over their keyboard. Instead,
                            help them write a better prompt. Ask them: "What are you trying to build? Who is it
                            for? What should it do?" Then help them structure that into the Prompt Formula.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Principle 2: Celebrate the Iteration</h3>
                        <p>
                            New users get discouraged when AI output is not perfect. Normalize iteration by
                            saying things like: "Good, that is the first version. Now let's make it better."
                            Show them that your own work also takes multiple iterations.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Principle 3: Point to the Process, Not the Answer</h3>
                        <p>
                            When someone is stuck, do not just give them the fix. Show them how you would
                            diagnose it: "Here is how I would prompt the AI to figure this out." Teach the
                            debugging prompts from this workshop. A person who can debug their own tools is
                            ten times more valuable than someone who needs help every time.

                                The goal of EDD is not to create a few experts. It is to create a culture where
                                everyone can solve their own problems with AI assistance. Every person you teach
                                to fish is one fewer request in your inbox.

                                Close with a round-table discussion: "What is one problem in your section that
                                you now feel confident you could solve using what you learned today?" Have each
                                participant share briefly. This reinforces confidence and gives you a sense of
                                where the training landed. Distribute the SOP and resource links before dismissal.
