                        <h3>Bridge from User to Builder</h3>
                        <p>
                            In AI Fluency Fundamentals you learned to manage AI as a user &mdash; writing prompts,
                            refining outputs, and judging quality inside a single conversation. Building tools is the
                            same set of skills applied at higher complexity. Instead of managing one conversation, you
                            are managing an entire project through AI. The 201 skills do not change; the scope does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Think of it this way: a user asks AI to draft an email. A builder asks AI to create the
                            system that drafts, tracks, and sends emails. The difference is not talent &mdash; it is
                            <strong>decomposition</strong>. You learn to see the system as parts, then build each part
                            with the same prompting skills you already have.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Builder Mindset: Decompose Before Building</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before you open any tool &mdash; before you type a single prompt &mdash; decompose on paper
                            or a whiteboard. What are the components? What does the data look like? What does the user
                            need to see? What actions do they need to take?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is <strong>Task Decomposition</strong> applied to system design. The quality of your
                            decomposition predicts the quality of your build. A vague plan produces a vague tool. A
                            specific plan produces a specific tool.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                The number-one mistake new builders make is opening the tool first and
                                &ldquo;figuring it out as they go.&rdquo; This works for simple tasks. It fails
                                completely for anything with more than two or three moving parts. Decompose first.
                                Always.

                                <strong>Decompose the problem on paper.</strong> Identify the data, the user actions,
                                and the components before writing a single prompt. If you skipped straight to
                                &ldquo;open the AI tool and start prompting,&rdquo; revisit the builder mindset

                        <p>
                            In this module you will build a working equipment checkout tracker for 1st Bn, 99th Marines
                            from scratch, using AI. Follow each step in order. By the end you will have a functional
                            web application and a repeatable process you can apply to any problem.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The problem: <em>&ldquo;I need a way to track equipment checkout for my section.&rdquo;</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before touching any tool, answer three questions on paper:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What data fields do I need?</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>What does the user need to do?</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>What is the simplest useful version?</strong></li>

  "I need a way to track equipment checkout for my section at 1st Bn, 99th Marines."

Data Fields Needed:
  - Item name (e.g., "PVS-14 Night Vision")
  - Serial number (alphanumeric, 6-12 characters)
  - Person checking out (name and rank)
  - Date checked out
  - Date due back
  - Status (Available, Checked Out, Overdue)

User Actions:
  1. Check out a piece of equipment
  2. Check equipment back in
  3. View a list of all overdue items

Simplest Useful Version:
  A single-page web app with a form, a table of all items,
  and an overdue-items view. No login, no database &mdash;
  browser storage is fine for a prototype.</div>

                            what you are asking AI to build. This is decomposition in action.

                            action, and the technology. Here is the prompt to use:
                        </p>

                        <div class="prompt-block">
                            <div class="prompt-block__header">Prompt &mdash; Initial Build</div>I need to build an equipment checkout tracker for a Marine Corps section.
Data fields: Item name, Serial number, Person checking out (name and rank),
Date checked out, Date due back, Status (Available, Checked Out, Overdue).
Users need to: check out equipment, check it back in, and see a list of
all overdue items. Build this as a simple web application using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. Start with just the data entry form.</div>

                        <p>
                            Copy this prompt into your AI tool and run it. You should receive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                            for a basic data entry form.

                                Your output should include a SharePoint list structure with columns for:

                            Before you do anything else, review what you got. Open the HTML file in a browser and check:

                                After this pass, your tracker should show a separate overdue items section
                                or visual indicator (typically red text or red background) for any item whose
                                due date is in the past. Each checked-out item should have a button or link
                                labeled &ldquo;Check In&rdquo; or similar. Clicking it should change the status
                                back to &ldquo;Available&rdquo; and remove the item from the overdue view.

                                Your form should now show a validation error message when the serial number
                                is outside the 6&ndash;12 alphanumeric character range. At the top of the page,
                                you should see a summary area displaying three counts: total items, currently
                                checked out, and overdue. These counts should update automatically when you add
                                a new entry or check an item back in. If the counts do not update, the AI likely
                                generated static text instead of dynamic counters &mdash; mention this in your
                                next refinement prompt.

                            <li>Try entering a serial number that is too short (e.g., &ldquo;AB1&rdquo;). Does it reject it?</li>
                            <li>Try a valid serial number (e.g., &ldquo;SN12345A&rdquo;). Does it accept it?</li>
                            <li>Do the summary counts update when you add or check in items?</li>

                            part of building. This module teaches you how to debug with AI so you can recover from
                            failures instead of quitting.

                        <p>
                            Imagine you click the &ldquo;Check Out&rdquo; button on your equipment tracker and nothing
                            happens. You open your browser&rsquo;s developer console (<kbd>F12</kbd> &rarr; Console tab)
                            and see this error:

                        </p>

                        <h4>Step 1: Read the Error Message</h4>
                        <p>
                            Break it down in plain language:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>&ldquo;Cannot read properties of null&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; JavaScript tried to access something that does not exist.</li>
                            <li><strong>&ldquo;reading &lsquo;value&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; Specifically, it tried to read the <code>.value</code> of a form field.</li>
                            <li><strong>&ldquo;at checkOutItem (tracker.js:42)&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; The crash happened on line 42 of tracker.js, inside a function called <code>checkOutItem</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Translation: the code is trying to get the value of a form field, but it cannot find that
                            field on the page.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Step 2: Send the Error to AI with Context</h4>
                        <div class="callout callout--info mt-sm">
                            <p><strong>What does "paste your code" mean?</strong> If you are using a browser-based AI tool, copy the entire HTML and JavaScript block the AI gave you. If you saved it to a file, open the file in a text editor and copy all the contents. The AI needs to see your code to find the bug.</p>

This happens when I click the "Check Out" button. Here's my code: [paste your full HTML/JS code here]. The form has fields for item name, serial number, person, date out, and date due.</div>

                        <p>
                            Notice the structure of this debugging prompt:

                        <ol>

                            <li><strong>What the code should do</strong> (context about your form fields)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Step 3: Understand the Fix</h4>
                        <p>
                            The most common cause of this error: an <strong>ID mismatch</strong> between your HTML and
                            JavaScript. For example, the HTML might use <code>id="serialNumber"</code> but the JavaScript
                            looks for <code>document.getElementById("serial-number")</code>. AI will identify the exact
                            mismatch and provide corrected code.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                                Debugging with AI is a skill. Copy the error, provide context, and iterate.
                                You do not need to understand every line of code &mdash; you need to understand the
                                process: <strong>read the error, give AI context, apply the fix, verify.</strong>

                        <p>
                            Not all failures produce error messages. Sometimes the code runs fine but produces the
                            wrong result. This is harder to catch and more important to practice.
                        </p>

                            Scenario: Your overdue calculation shows items as overdue <em>even after they were returned</em>.
                            An item with status &ldquo;Available&rdquo; still shows up highlighted in red in the overdue
                            view. The console has no errors.
                        </p>

                            <div class="prompt-block__header">Prompt &mdash; Logic Error Debugging</div>My equipment tracker's overdue calculation is wrong. Items that have been returned (status is "Available") still show up in the overdue items list highlighted in red. The overdue check should only apply to items with status "Checked Out" whose due date is in the past. Here's my code: [paste code]. Can you find the logic error?</div>

                        <p>
                            The likely cause: the overdue check compares the due date to today but does <em>not</em>
                            check the status first. It flags every item whose due date has passed, regardless of
                            whether it has been returned. The fix is a simple conditional: only flag items where
                            <code>status === "Checked Out"</code> <em>and</em> the due date is past.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Apply the fix. Return an item and verify it disappears from the overdue list.

                        <p>
                            Now it is your turn. Pick a real problem from your work &mdash; something you or your
                            section actually deals with &mdash; and decompose it using the same framework from
                            Module 2. Before you fill in the blank template, study the completed example below.

  "I need a sign-out log for the armory that tracks who has what weapon
   at 1st Bn, 99th Marines."

Subtask 1: Design the data model (weapon type, serial, assigned Marine, date/time out, date/time in)
  [Human designs]

Subtask 2: Build the sign-out form with weapon selection and Marine lookup
  [AI builds]

Subtask 3: Build the sign-in process with timestamp and condition notes
  [AI builds]

Subtask 4: Create a real-time dashboard showing all weapons currently signed out
  [AI builds]

Subtask 5: Verify serial number formats match actual USMC weapon serial conventions
  [Human verifies]

Pattern: Centaur
  Reason: Weapons tracking is high-stakes. Human makes all design decisions
  and verifies all outputs. AI handles implementation but human validates
  every record format and business rule.

Frontier Risks:
  - AI may not know USMC serial number formats for specific weapon systems
  - AI may not understand armory accountability regulations
  - Condition reporting categories may need SME input</div>

                            <li>Each subtask is small enough to accomplish in one or two prompts.</li>
                            <li>Every subtask has a clear label: Human designs, AI builds, or Human verifies.</li>
                            <li>The centaur pattern was chosen because weapons tracking has no room for error.</li>
                            <li>Frontier risks identify where AI&rsquo;s knowledge runs out.</li>

                                Look at each subtask. Could any one of them be broken down further? A subtask is too big if it would take more than 3 AI prompts to complete, or if you cannot describe the expected output in one sentence. If a subtask
                                feels like it would take more than two or three prompts to complete, it is too big.
                                Split it. Also check: did you identify at least one frontier risk? Every problem
                                has at least one area where AI&rsquo;s training data will not perfectly match your
