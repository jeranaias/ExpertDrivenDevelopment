                                This page assumes you completed Builder Orientation and attempted your
                                first build. You should already be familiar with the centaur/cyborg
                                distinction, the EDD SOP, and basic Power Platform navigation. If any
                                of that is unfamiliar, go back and complete
                                <a href="orientation.html">Builder Orientation</a> first.

                        <h3>Step 1: Verify Your Access</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before building anything, confirm you can reach all three platforms you will
                            use today. Open each link and verify you can log in:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>SharePoint:</strong> Navigate to your unit SharePoint site and confirm you can create a new list</li>
                            <li><strong>Power Apps:</strong> Go to <code>make.powerapps.com</code> and verify you see the Home screen</li>
                            <li><strong>Power Automate:</strong> Go to <code>make.powerautomate.com</code> and verify you can create a new flow</li>

                            <p>
                                If you cannot log in to any of these platforms, contact your IT support
                                before proceeding. You will need all three for every build in this course.
                                Do not skip this step &mdash; resolving access issues during a build wastes
                                significant time.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Centaur mode</strong> is the better choice here. Leave tracking involves
                                specific regulations, approval chains, and date calculations that must be
                                accurate. You want to design all the business rules up front (who approves,
                                what the limits are, what happens with overlapping requests), then let AI
                                build it, then verify every rule works correctly. Getting leave calculations
                                wrong has real consequences for Marines, so the slower-but-reliable centaur
                                pattern is appropriate.

                                Cyborg mode could work for the dashboard or reporting layer once the core
                                logic is verified &mdash; but the foundational workflow should be centaur.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Problem:</strong> 1st Bn, 99th Marines needs a request routing workflow.
                            Someone submits a request, it goes to the right approver based on the dollar
                            amount, the approver acts on it, and the requester gets notified of the
                            decision. You will build this on Power Platform using the centaur pattern.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Explicit Centaur Pattern</h3>
                        <p>
                            This build follows five distinct phases with clear boundaries between them.
                            At each boundary, you &mdash; the human &mdash; verify before moving on.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Phase 1 -->
                        <h4>Phase 1 &mdash; Human Designs (You Do This)</h4>
                        <p>
                            Before touching AI, define everything on paper or a whiteboard. Map out
                            every business rule, every data flow, every edge case. This is the most
                            important phase &mdash; the quality of your design determines the quality of
                            the final product.

Create a SharePoint list design for a request routing system. Columns needed:

Approver (person), Date Submitted (date), Date Resolved (date).

amount (under $500 &rarr; Section Leader, $500-$2000 &rarr; Dept Head, over $2000 &rarr; CO),
send an approval email to the right person, and update the SharePoint list

I tested the request routing workflow and found these issues:

1. [Describe specific issue — e.g., "When I submit a $1500 request, it routes
   to the Section Leader instead of the Department Head"]
2. [Describe specific issue — e.g., "There is no auto-escalation after 48 hours.
   The flow ends after sending the initial approval email"]
3. [Describe specific issue — e.g., "The requester never receives a confirmation
   email after submitting"]

For each issue: here is what I expected, here is what happened instead.
Fix each one and explain what you changed.</div>

                                separation is what makes centaur mode reliable for critical workflows.

                            Before moving on to your next build, take 15 minutes to reflect on what

                                <strong>Error handling for nested conditions and missing edge case paths.</strong>
                                AI is good at building the "happy path" &mdash; the flow that works when
                                everything goes as expected. But it frequently misses error handling for
                                nested conditions (what happens when a condition inside another condition
                                fails?) and omits edge case paths entirely (what if the approver field is
                                empty? what if the amount is exactly $500?).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is why Phase 3 verification is non-negotiable. You must test the
                                paths the AI is most likely to forget.

                            a rough idea and iterate. Use these prompts as your starting sequence, then
                            continue the conversation based on what the AI produces.

I need a training tracker for my Marine Corps section in 1st Bn, 99th Marines.
It should track 6 Marines across 5 required training events. I need to see at
a glance who is current, who is overdue, and who has events scheduled. Build
this as a SharePoint list with a Power App gallery view.</div>

                        <p>
                            Review the output. Does the data model make sense? Are the right columns

                                Cyborg mode is faster but requires constant attention. You cannot walk
                                away and let the AI run. You are evaluating and redirecting at each step,
                                discovering requirements as you build rather than executing a predetermined
                                plan. Notice how different this feels from the centaur build &mdash; that
                                difference is deliberate, and knowing when to use which pattern is one of
                                the core skills this course develops.
