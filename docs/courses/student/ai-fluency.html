                        <p>
                            By the end of this course you will be able to apply six skills that research
                            identifies as the actual predictors of sustained AI adoption:

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Context Assembly</strong> &mdash; giving AI the right information to produce useful output</li>
                            <li><strong>Quality Judgment</strong> &mdash; knowing whether AI output is correct, complete, and appropriate</li>
                            <li><strong>Task Decomposition</strong> &mdash; breaking large tasks into AI-appropriate subtasks</li>
                            <li><strong>Iterative Refinement</strong> &mdash; improving AI output through structured feedback loops</li>
                            <li><strong>Workflow Integration</strong> &mdash; embedding AI into recurring processes, not one-off experiments</li>
                            <li><strong>Frontier Recognition</strong> &mdash; knowing what AI can and cannot do, and when that boundary shifts</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Module 1: Why 80% Quit</h2>

                        <h3>The Pattern You Need to Recognize</h3>
                        <p>
                            Microsoft tracked hundreds of thousands of employees using AI tools. Excitement peaked
                            for about three weeks. Then came a crater of disappointment. The vast majority quietly
                            stopped. The 20% who survived didn&rsquo;t write better prompts &mdash; they learned to
                            <strong>manage AI like a capable but inexperienced team member</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why People Fail</h3>
                        <p>Here is the typical failure arc. See if it sounds familiar:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You type &ldquo;help me with this report&rdquo; and get something generic.</li>
                            <li>You try again and get something confident and wrong.</li>
                            <li>You try a third time and decide it&rsquo;s faster to do it yourself.</li>
                            <li>You never come back.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            That failure is not your fault. It is a training problem. Nobody showed you the right
                            skills because most organizations do not know what they are yet.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Evidence That Training Works</h3>
                        <p>
                            The UK government gave AI tools to 20,000 workers across 12 departments with proper
                            training and support. After three months, <strong>over 80% didn&rsquo;t want to give them
                            up</strong>. Workers reported saving 25 minutes a day &mdash; nearly two weeks a year.
                            Nine of twelve departments kept their licenses. The difference wasn&rsquo;t the tool.
                            It was the training.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why This Training Is Different</h3>
                        <p>
                            This course is not teaching you how to use a tool. It is teaching you how to
                            <strong>manage</strong> one. The same skills that make you a good leader &mdash; breaking
                            work into pieces, knowing what good looks like, giving constructive feedback, verifying
                            quality &mdash; are the skills that make you effective with AI.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Management Framing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Would you hand a 100-page RFP to a brand new Marine and say &ldquo;handle this&rdquo;?
                            No. You would break it into pieces. You would tell them which parts to tackle first.
                            You would explain what good looks like. You would review their work and give
                            feedback. That is exactly how you should work with AI.
                        </p>

                                <p>
                                    The key difference is not prompt quality, tool selection, or technical aptitude.
                                    The 20% who persist treat AI as a <strong>team member to be managed</strong> &mdash;
                                    they break work into pieces, provide context, review output critically, and refine
                                    iteratively. The 80% who quit expected magic on the first try, got disappointed,
                                    and never developed the management skills that make AI useful.

                        <h2>Module 2: The Six Skills That Actually Matter</h2>
                        <p>
                            These are the six 201-level skills. For each one, you will see the difference between
                            how most people use AI (101 behavior) and how effective users work (201 behavior).
                            Study the examples carefully &mdash; the gap between the two is where the value lives.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Skill 1 &mdash; Context Assembly</h3>
                        <p>
                            AI is extremely sensitive to context quality. The difference between mediocre and
                            useful output is usually the information <em>you</em> provide.
                        </p>

                            <pre><code>Write a counseling statement for a Lance Corporal who was late to

                                The expert prompt provides five pieces of context the vague prompt lacks: rank,
                                situation, tone, format reference, and document type. Each one steers the AI away
                                from generic output and toward something you could actually use.

                            AI can be confidently correct and confidently wrong in the same paragraph. Your job is

                                The Brynjolfsson study found AI helped novice workers improve by 34% &mdash; but only
                                because the AI was disseminating expert-level patterns. The experts still catch what

All personnel are reminded to exercise caution and good judgment
during the upcoming liberty period. The forecast calls for variable
weather conditions in the local area. All Marines and Sailors should
plan accordingly and ensure they have appropriate clothing and
supplies for any outdoor activities.

Personnel are expected to adhere to all applicable regulations
regarding alcohol consumption, vehicle operation, and personal
conduct. Designated drivers should be arranged in advance for any
social gatherings involving alcohol. Report any incidents to the
chain of command immediately.

All hands are reminded to maintain situational awareness at all
times. Avoid high-risk activities that could result in injury or
harm. Take care of your fellow Marines and do not allow them to
make poor decisions.

The chain of command remains available throughout the weekend for
any issues that arise. Enjoy the time off and return to duty
prepared for the training week ahead.</code></pre>

Listen up. We made it through another week. Before I cut you
loose, here's what you need to know.

Weather this weekend: Saturday is going to be wet — rain most of
the day, high of 62. Sunday clears up and should be decent. Plan
accordingly. If you're doing anything outdoors Saturday, bring rain
gear and don't be the guy who ends up hypothermic because he wanted
to tough it out in a t-shirt.

If you're drinking, have a plan. I don't care if it's two beers
or ten — you are not driving. Set up a designated driver before
you go out, not after your fourth round. Ride shares exist. Use
them.

Look out for each other. If your buddy is about to do something
stupid, stop him. That's not being soft — that's being a Marine.

If something goes sideways this weekend, do not try to hide it.
Call up the chain immediately. We can deal with almost anything
if we know about it early. What we can't deal with is finding
out Monday morning that something happened Friday night.

Enjoy the weekend. Come back ready to work.</code></pre>

                            It is not intuitive: AI may excel at a task you expect it to fail at, and fail at a
                            task you expect it to handle easily. Worse, the frontier shifts as models improve.

                        <h2>Module 3: The Delegation Equation</h2>

                        <h3>Three Questions Before You Delegate</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before handing any task to AI, run it through these three questions. This is
                            Mollick&rsquo;s framework, and it prevents the two most common mistakes: delegating
                            tasks AI cannot do well, and refusing to delegate tasks AI would handle fine.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Human Baseline Time</strong> &mdash; How long would this take you to do yourself?</li>
                            <li><strong>Probability of Success</strong> &mdash; How likely is AI to produce acceptable output?</li>
                            <li><strong>AI Process Time</strong> &mdash; How long to write the prompt, wait, and evaluate the result?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            The math is simple: if (AI Process Time / Probability of Success) is less than
                            Human Baseline Time, delegate. If not, do it yourself.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Example 1: Writing a 5-Paragraph Order</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Human baseline:</strong> 4 hours</li>
                            <li><strong>AI drafts:</strong> minutes</li>
                            <li><strong>Review time:</strong> 45 minutes</li>
                            <li><strong>Probability AI gets it right:</strong> ~70%</li>
                            <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> Delegate. Even at 70% accuracy, you save hours. The review catches what AI misses, and you are still done in under an hour instead of four.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Example 2: Calculating TIS/TIG</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Human baseline:</strong> 5 minutes</li>
                            <li><strong>AI process:</strong> Checking AI&rsquo;s math takes as long as doing it yourself</li>
                            <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> Don&rsquo;t delegate. The task is so fast that the overhead of prompting, waiting, and verifying eliminates any savings.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Example 3: Quarterly Training Schedule</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Human baseline:</strong> 6 hours</li>
                            <li><strong>AI produces:</strong> Good first-draft structure</li>
                            <li><strong>Review time:</strong> 30 minutes</li>
                            <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> Delegate the structure, fill in the specifics yourself. AI builds the skeleton; you provide the unit-specific knowledge that makes it real.</li>
                        </ul>

                                The more expertise you have, the better you are at all three variables. You
                                estimate human baseline time more accurately. You judge AI success probability
                                more accurately. You review AI output faster. AI does not replace expertise &mdash;
                                it <strong>rewards</strong> it.

                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Human Baseline Time:</strong> How long does this task take you now?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Probability of Success:</strong> If you gave AI good context, how likely is it to produce something acceptable? (Be honest &mdash; 50%? 80%? 30%?)</li>

                                    Would you delegate it? If AI Process Time divided by Probability of Success is
                                    less than your Human Baseline Time, the answer is yes. If it is close, try it
                                    once and see. If it is clearly not worth it, move on to the next task.

                            Below are three AI-generated documents for 1st Bn, 99th Marines. Each one looks
                            professional. Each one contains at least one error that would matter if you signed
                            it and sent it up the chain. Your job: <strong>red pen each document. Mark everything
                            you would change before signing.</strong>

<strong>AFTER ACTION REPORT &mdash; Company-Level Combined Arms Exercise</strong><br>
<strong>Wpns Co, 1st Bn 99th Marines</strong><br>
<strong>Date of Exercise: 28&ndash;30 Jan 2026</strong><br>
<br>
1. OVERVIEW: Wpns Co executed a three-day combined arms live-fire exercise at Range 410, integrating mortar, heavy machine gun, and anti-armor sections in support of a simulated battalion attack. The exercise evaluated the company&rsquo;s ability to synchronize fires across multiple weapons systems per MCRP 3-30A.2, <em>Employment of Combined Arms</em>.<br>
<br>
2. KEY OBSERVATIONS:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A. SUSTAIN: Fire direction center procedures were well-rehearsed and executed efficiently. Mortar section achieved effects on target within 90 seconds of call-for-fire in 8 of 10 iterations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;B. SUSTAIN: Communication between the CAAT section and the company COC was clear and consistent throughout the exercise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;C. IMPROVE: Transition between targets for the heavy machine gun section was slower than doctrinal standard. Average transition time was 14 seconds vs. the 8-second standard.<br>
<br>
3. RECOMMENDATIONS:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Schedule additional dry-fire drills for MG section focusing on target transition and sector scanning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Conduct a combined rehearsal with the supported infantry company prior to the next battalion-level exercise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Request additional range time in March to re-evaluate MG section performance after remedial training.

                                    <strong>Error: Wrong leave type.</strong> The subject line and paragraph 1 both say
                                    &ldquo;Annual Leave,&rdquo; but paragraph 2 makes clear that LCpl Nakamura is
                                    attending Corporals Course &mdash; a professional military education school. This
                                    is <strong>Permissive TAD (PTAD)</strong>, not Annual Leave. Charging a Marine
                                    annual leave for PME attendance is incorrect and would cost the Marine chargeable

                                AI-generated documents will look professional. The formatting will be clean. The

                                hide inside polished output. The Red Pen Review is not a one-time exercise. It is
                                a permanent habit. Every AI output you sign gets the red pen treatment. Every time.

                        <h3>Two Patterns for Human-AI Work</h3>
                        <p>
                            Research identifies two productive patterns for how humans and AI work together.
                            Understanding which pattern fits your task is key to using AI effectively.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Centaur:</strong> Clear division of labor. Human does Phase 1, AI does
                                Phase 2, human reviews Phase 3. Best for high-stakes work where you need a clean
                                handoff and thorough review. Think of it as sequential &mdash; you take turns.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Cyborg:</strong> Continuous integration. Fluid boundary between human and
                                AI contributions. Best for creative and iterative work where you refine together
                                in real time. Think of it as simultaneous &mdash; you work in tandem.
                            </li>

                            <h3 class="callout__title">When to Use Each Pattern</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Centaur</strong> works best when the stakes are high and you need an audit trail
                                &mdash; legal documents, personnel actions, financial reports. You know exactly where
                                the human work ends and the AI work begins.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-sm">
                                <strong>Cyborg</strong> works best when you are creating something iteratively &mdash;
                                drafting correspondence, brainstorming plans, building briefing outlines. The boundary
                                between your input and AI output blurs, and that is fine because the stakes are lower.

                        <p>
                            The jagged frontier is different for every role. A supply clerk&rsquo;s frontier
                            looks nothing like an intelligence analyst&rsquo;s. Your job is to start mapping
                            yours. Use three columns: what AI handles well for your work, what it handles
                            poorly, and what is on the moving edge &mdash; tasks you should re-test periodically
                            as models improve.
                        </p>

                            These are example entries. Your frontier map will have different items based on
                            your MOS, billet, and daily tasks. Start with three entries in each column and
                            update it as you gain experience.

                                The goal is not perfection. The goal is one real attempt with a real task so you have
                                concrete experience to build on. The 80% who quit never got past the generic first try.
                                You will.

                        <h3>For Those Continuing to Builder Orientation</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you are moving on to the <a href="orientation.html">Builder Orientation</a> course,
                            come prepared with a <strong>specific problem</strong> you want to solve. Be ready to
                            decompose it into subtasks. Builder Orientation assumes you can already apply all six
                            201 skills &mdash; there you will put them to work building actual tools.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What You Now Know</h3>
                        <p>
                            You are now equipped with the same judgment framework that separates sustained AI
                            adopters from the 80% who quit. The skills you practiced today &mdash; Context Assembly,
                            Quality Judgment, Task Decomposition, Iterative Refinement, Workflow Integration, and
                            Frontier Recognition &mdash; are not about any particular tool. They are about how you
                            think. That is what makes them durable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The research is clear: trained users with these skills save meaningful time, produce
                            better work, and keep using AI months after the initial excitement fades. You have the
                            skills. Now go use them.
