## Overview

Expert-Driven Development (EDD) is a methodology that teaches domain experts to build institutional software using AI as scaffolding, not as an end-state dependency. It is designed for military instructors, staff NCOs, officers, and DoW civilians who have real problems to solve but no coding background. This repository contains the complete training curriculum (five courses covering every role from first-time AI users to experienced builders to supervisors), the Standard Operating Procedure, an interactive toolkit, and downloadable templates. Everything here is open-source, unclassified, and ready to use.

## The Problem

Domain experts understand their problems better than anyone, but they cannot build the solutions themselves. Traditional software development requires contractors, months of lead time, and significant budgets. The people closest to the problem remain disconnected from the tools that could solve it.

## The Solution

EDD uses AI as scaffolding to let domain experts build, document, and maintain their own tools on approved platforms. The tools outlast the AI -- they are standard applications running on standard infrastructure, not black-box AI products. One instructor built a system serving 440 users in 30 hours at zero cost.

## Four-Layer Framework

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|:-----:|:-----|:--------|
| 1 | **Train** | Develop AI-fluent builders through structured coursework |
| 2 | **Build** | Create institutional tools using AI-assisted development |
| 3 | **Document** | Ensure continuity, replication, and knowledge transfer |
| 4 | **Scale** | Spread capability organically across the organization |

## Training Courses

| Course | Duration | Audience | Outcome |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| **AI Fluency Fundamentals** | 2 hours | All personnel | Understand six 201 skills, recognize the jagged frontier, map AI into workflow |
| **Builder Orientation** | 2 hours | Aspiring builders | Build a working prototype, apply task decomposition and iterative refinement |
| **Platform Training** | 4 hours | Builders | Build 3 complete tools on Power Platform using centaur and cyborg patterns |
| **Advanced Workshop** | 4 hours | Experienced builders | Map the frontier, build verification protocols, teach others |
| **Supervisor Orientation** | 30 minutes | Leadership | Create permission culture, evaluate proposals, understand apprentice problem |

## Quick Start

1. **Read the SOP** -- Understand the methodology, governance model, and approval process.
   [SOP (PDF)](pdf/SOP_Expert_Driven_Development_v5.pdf)

2. **Take Training 1** -- Complete the AI-Fluent Development Orientation to build your first prototype.
   [Training Curricula (PDF)](pdf/TRAINING_CURRICULA_v5.pdf)

3. **Pick a problem and build** -- Use the templates to define your problem, plan your tool, and document the result.

## Proof of Concept

- **MCD Tutoring Application** -- 440 users, 30 hours to build, $0 cost, ATO approved
- **DonDocs (Marine Coders)** -- 300 unique users/day on MCEN, MIU recognized
- **Tanaghum** -- ILR-calibrated Arabic listening lessons, built in 2 days, in use by MLIs
- **Harakat** -- Arabic diacritization system, 0.68% DER
- **Mutawazin** -- Arabic typing proficiency trainer
